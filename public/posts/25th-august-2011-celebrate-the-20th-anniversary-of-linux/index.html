<p>The NFL offseason is starting to heat up. We have the combine getting underway this week and we’re only two weeks away from the start of free agency.

With that said, he and Fitzpatrick were definitely on the same page and Hopkins contributed a huge 40.30 points to the team that relied upon him.LOYOLA: Yeah. I don’t know. I mean, I just I recall, you know, certain players for San Francisco wide receivers that like to go out of bounds before they get hit and this has nothing to do with that, of course.
