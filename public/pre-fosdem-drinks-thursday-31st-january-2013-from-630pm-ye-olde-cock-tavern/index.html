  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Pre-FOSDEM drinks because I’m hoping to get people involved who may be visiting in London that night because they will be heading off to FOSDEM the next day. But even if you’re not heading to FOSDEM you should still come because not only will you be meeting a great bunch of people you’ll also be able to claim some O’Reilly merch from me including some books. We’ll be upstairs at the top of the pub, the stairs on your right immediately as you walk in. You’ll know it’s the right place because I’ll have a Tux sitting around in the room. Really looking forward to seeing you all there. The details: From 6.30pm ’til Late – 31st January 2013 Ye Olde Cock Tavern, 22 Fleet Street, Holborn, EC4Y 1AA Nearest tube: Temple (Circle/District Line) Nearest train: City Thames Link">
