The Greater London Linux User Group are pleased to announce the next Drink Up on Thursday 20th September from 6pm at The William Blake pub on Old Street.

We have an are booked at the back of The William Blake pub for Thursday 20th of September from 6pm. The Drink Up is an opportunity to meet new and different people after work while having a few drinks and some food. It's pretty close to Old Street station, does some good food and we have access to a projector and speaker system so if you would like to show something too you can. Anyone is welcome to come along, especially if they're interested in finding out more about programming, open hardware, Linux, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Free-software and it's culture.

You'll know you're in the right place because there will be a plushy Tux toy near-by.
