Due to our long-standing GLLUG maintained mailing list being out of service for over a month now we have joined forces with [lug.org.uk](http://lug.org.uk/) and are now running a temporary mailing list with them. Most of the previous subscribers have been re-invited to this new list, but if you are new, welcome and please join our new list.

All the [instructions for subscribing are here](http://mailman.lug.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/gllug).
