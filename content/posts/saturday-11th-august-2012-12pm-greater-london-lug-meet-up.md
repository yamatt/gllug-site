The Greater London Linux User Group are excited to announce the first meeting of the group for over two years. We would like to warmly invite anyone who is keen to discover something new about Linux, Android, Free and Open Source Software, Open Hardware and Free Culture to attend and meet new people with the same interests.

There will be talks from members of the community as well as the option for anyone to show off something cool too. Followed by drinks in a local public house called The Fox from around 4pm.
