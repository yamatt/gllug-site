I know, I know. First meet up in a long time, but I've been working on the South London Makerspace which is now a real thing so lets meet there!

The South London Makerspace is a hackerspace like community in South London with a focus on social and education.

The plan is to meet, chat, educate. There will be informal talks, **volunteers for talks needed**. I plan to give an introduction about the Makerspace.

If you want a drink please bring your own along, or some to share, there is also a Costcutter next door and a Sainsburys near-by. Chairs are limited so please prioritize people who need them or bring your own.

Looking forward to seeing you all there.
