The next talk is titled "Wire Shark and the basics of network traffic monitoring." and will be given by Nahual Marisi and John Sharp.

We have a slight change of venue, we will still be meeting at the University of Westminster (Cavendish Campus), but in Room C1.04. If people could arrive for 1900, ready for the talk to begin at 1930. I will try and get some signs made up to direct people to room C1.04 Hopefully there will be a trip to a local pub for social and technical chit-chat.

I feel the "I'm going" email's were unpopular and Sean had a sign-in sheet organised on the day anyway. So I think we should stick people just turning up and signing in. (ie you don't have to email the list or me explicitly stating you are going, unless you **really really** want us to know.)
