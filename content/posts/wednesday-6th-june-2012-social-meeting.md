After the somewhat successful relaunch of the Lincolnshire LUG and the <br />  
huge turn out at the GitHub London drink up a few weeks ago it really <br />  
is time to get the largest Linux user base in the UK back together. <br />  
<br />  
We're starting out informally, just to gauge interest and to discuss <br />  
plans, locations, dates etc. over a few drinks. We want as many people <br />  
to come along as possible. Whether you're a GLLUG regular, or simply <br />  
have an interest in finding out more about Linux or Free software. <br />  
<br />  
We have booked out a section of The Skinners Arms (5 minutes walk from <br />  
Kings Cross Station) for the 6th of June from 6pm. You can find us at <br />  
the back and we'll be bringing along a little fluffy Tux so you'll know <br />  
you're in the right place. <br />  
<br />  
The Skinners Arms has a great selection of beers and a pretty standard menu. <br />  
<br />  
We've booked for 30 people so we're hoping to freak out the Landlord <br />  
and get many more than that. If you're having difficulties finding the <br />  
place or what more information you can e-mail <a href="mailto:mattcopp+gllug@gmail.com">Matthew Copperwaite</a>.<br />  
<br />  
Really hope to see you there. <br />

PESCA: Twenty four kickers have ever gone six for six or better. Now, it’s weird, just as you mentioned. So, the team, the offense, has to be good enough [http://www.cheapjerseys11.com](http://www.cheapjerseys11.com/) to get the kicker in position but not so good that [Wholesale NFL Jerseys](http://www.cheapnfljerseysx.com/) they score touchdowns, right? So, usually an offense is either good or bad. It’s not, like, halfway good. And so I went back to all these guys who made six for six or better, and it turns out that their defenses were excellent at turning the other team over. The kicker’s teams averaged four turnovers or they induced four turnovers a game. It’s more than, or it’s about twice as much, as the NFL usually averages. And then you begin to see, ah. So, what happens is their offense is bad, their offense can’t move the ball but then the kicker is in a position to make the kick because of what their defense did.
