After the somewhat successful relaunch of the Lincolnshire LUG and the huge turn out at the GitHub London drink up a few weeks ago it really is time to get the largest Linux user base in the UK back together.

We're starting out informally, just to gauge interest and to discuss plans, locations, dates etc. over a few drinks. We want as many people to come along as possible. Whether you're a GLLUG regular, or simply  have an interest in finding out more about Linux or Free software.

We have booked out a section of The Skinners Arms (5 minutes walk from  Kings Cross Station) for the 6th of June from 6pm. You can find us at  the back and we'll be bringing along a little fluffy Tux so you'll know  you're in the right place.

The Skinners Arms has a great selection of beers and a pretty standard menu.

We've booked for 30 people so we're hoping to freak out the Landlord  and get many more than that. If you're having difficulties finding the  place or what more information you can e-mail [Matthew Copperwaite](mailto:mattcopp+gllug@gmail.com).

Really hope to see you there.
