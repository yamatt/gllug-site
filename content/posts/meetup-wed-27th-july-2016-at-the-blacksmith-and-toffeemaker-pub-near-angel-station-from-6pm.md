Not to make this look like a 6 monthly meetup, but that’s what it’s going to be.

We’ll be meeting on Wednesday the 27th of July 2016 from 6pm at [The Blacksmith and Toffeemaker pub](http://www.theblacksmithandthetoffeemaker.co.uk/), a 5 minute walk from Angel tube station, or just behind City University.

It’s a new venue for us, not sure what to expect. Wear a geeky shirt or t-shirt so we can identify each other, don’t forget to bring a friend.

Look forward to seeing you there.
