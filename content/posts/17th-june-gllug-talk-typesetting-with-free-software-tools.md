The next talk is titled "Typesetting with Free Software Tools" and will be given by Tethys.

After being introduced to the wonders of Unix at university, Tethys was hooked. With the release of Linux a few years later, he was able to use Unix at home as well, and has never looked back. He has interests in digital typography, large system design, and playing with LARTC. His career has alternated between coding and sysadmin for various companies in various industries. One of those was in the pre-press department of a large newspaper group, where an interest in typesetting became a profession for a while. He is currently at the coding end of the spectrum, writing software for a small company using statistical analysis to predict future trends.

We are returning to our previous venue at the University of Westminster, in the Large Lecture Theatre. If people could arrive for 1900, ready for the talk to begin at 1930. At the end of the talk we usually visit the pub for a few drinks, general chat and socialising.

Sean has a sign-in sheet organised on the day for people to sign so he can get an idea of attendance.
