There will be a talk for the GLLUG by Richard Jones on libguestfs[1] on Thursday 18th March at 1930. It will be held at the Cavendish campus of the University of Westminster, in the Large Lecture Theatre. I will try and get a more accurate description of the lecture theatre's location and post it to the mailing list and website. If people could arrive at 1900 to make sure we are ready to begin at 1930. After the talk I suggest we go to a decent local pub for a social.

Please email [general.mooney-at-googlemail.com](mailto:general.mooney@googlemail.com) if you are attending in order to get an idea of the expected number of people.
