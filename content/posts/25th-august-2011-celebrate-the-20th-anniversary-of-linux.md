On 25th August 1991 Linus Torvalds announced that he had been working on a new PC (80386) operating system.

Now, 20 years later we all know and (mostly) love Linux, the fruit of his labours.

To celebrate this GLLUG (and others) will meet on 25th August at Mabel's Tavern, 9 Mabledon Place, WC1H 9AZ from 5pm onwards.

Mabel's Tavern is a "Shepherd Neame" pub so we can expect to drink real beer. They serve food too.

You can see details of the pub at <a href="http://www.mabelstavern.co.uk/" title="www.mabelstavern.co.uk">http://www.mabelstavern.co.uk/</a>
