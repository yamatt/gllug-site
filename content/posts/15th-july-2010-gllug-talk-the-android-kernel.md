The this months talk will be about the Android kernel and will be given by Sunny Aujla.

He will be talking about the history, a view of android in mainstream linux, the Google changes, and the future of the Android kernel.

This month we have another change of venue, we are back at UCL! Ron Gaston has kindly booked room 1.02 in the Malet Place Engineering Building which if I remember correctly you have to enter through the Roberts building.

If people could arrive for 1900, ready for the talk to begin at 1930.

At the end of the talk we usually visit the pub (Jeremy Bentham?) for a few drinks, general chat and socialising.
