Much like London busses, a second London Linux event has also come along.

FOSS Talk Live 2016 is a free evening of Linux podcasts on Saturday 6th August at The Harrison near Kings Cross. The main event is ticketed, taking place in the basement of the pub and I expect there will be a large public social gathering upstairs in the main bar area.

All of the tickets for the main event have been reserved but I expect that in the time between the four live shows, people will congregate upstairs and that not everyone will go down to watch every show.

So if you are in London on the evening of the 6th August, come along. This isn’t an official GLLUG meet up but there will almost definitely be like minded people there and it should be good fun.
