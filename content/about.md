GLLUG's purpose is to bring together London's Linux users so they can share experiences and expertise (or revel in their inexperience and quest for expertise), to chat about the state of the (Linux) world, that sort of thing.

There are no membership fees, just pop along to a meeting, or join the mailing lists or IRC channel which you can find on the left bar.
