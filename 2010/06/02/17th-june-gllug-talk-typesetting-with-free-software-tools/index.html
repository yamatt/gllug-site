The next talk is titled “Typesetting with Free Software Tools” and will be given by Tethys.
After being introduced to the wonders of Unix at university, Tethys was hooked. With the release of Linux a few years later, he was able to use Unix at home as well, and has never looked back. He has interests in digital typography, large system design, and playing with LARTC. His career has alternated between coding and sysadmin for various companies in various industries. One of those was in the pre-press department of a large newspaper group, where an interest in typesetting became a profession for a while. He is currently at the coding end of the spectrum, writing software for a small company using statistical analysis to predict future trends."><meta property="og:url" content="https://gllug.org.uk/2010/06/02/17th-june-gllug-talk-typesetting-with-free-software-tools/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Greater London Linux User Group"><meta property="og:title" content="17th June - GLLUG Talk - Typesetting with Free Software Tools"><meta property="og:description" content="Date: Thursday, June 17th, 2010 Time: 7:30pm – 9:30pm Location: Univ of Westminster Campus Street: New Cavendish Street City/Town: London
