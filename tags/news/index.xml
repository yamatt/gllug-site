&lt;p&gt;There is still much to do, and it will take time to put everything back together but this is the first step in the right direction. I hope to see you all at a meet soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>New (Temporary) Mailing List</title><link>https://gllug.org.uk/2012/06/20/new-temporary-mailing-list/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2012 16:52:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gllug.org.uk/2012/06/20/new-temporary-mailing-list/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Due to our long-standing GLLUG maintained mailing list being out of service for over a month now we have joined forces with &lt;a href="http://lug.org.uk/"&gt;lug.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; and are now running a temporary mailing list with them.
