&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://positive-internet.com/"&gt;Positive Internet&lt;/a&gt; contacted me last week letting me know I was using PHP 5.6 &amp;ndash; which I subsequently realised went out of support about 7 years ago at this point &amp;ndash; I had kind of forgotten I was responsible for the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, given the site ran Wordpress, I was astounded the site hadn&amp;rsquo;t been done over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postivie Internet kindly let me know that the upgrade might cause Wordpress to break.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Welcome to the new GLLUG site</title><link>https://gllug.org.uk/2015/12/21/welcome-to-the-new-gllug-site/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2015 10:44:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gllug.org.uk/2015/12/21/welcome-to-the-new-gllug-site/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The old site died with a database error and after several months and no improvement, I’ve decided to relaunch the site with the fantastic support of &lt;a href="http://positive-internet.com/"&gt;Positive Internet&lt;/a&gt;, who were also able to swap everything over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still much to do, and it will take time to put everything back together but this is the first step in the right direction. I hope to see you all at a meet soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>New (Temporary) Mailing List</title><link>https://gllug.org.uk/2012/06/20/new-temporary-mailing-list/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2012 16:52:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gllug.org.uk/2012/06/20/new-temporary-mailing-list/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Due to our long-standing GLLUG maintained mailing list being out of service for over a month now we have joined forces with &lt;a href="http://lug.org.uk/"&gt;lug.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; and are now running a temporary mailing list with them.
