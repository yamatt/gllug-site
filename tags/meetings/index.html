Whether you&rsquo;re a GLLUG regular, or simply have an interest in finding out more about Linux or Free software.</p><p>We have booked out a section of The Skinners Arms (5 minutes walk from Kings Cross Station) for the 6th of June from 6pm. You can find us at the back and we&rsquo;ll be bringing along a little fluffy Tux so you&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re in the right place.</p><p>The Skinners Arms has a great selection of beers and a pretty standard menu.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve booked for 30 people so we&rsquo;re hoping to freak out the Landlord and get many more than that. If you&rsquo;re having difficulties finding the place or what more information you can e-mail <a href=mailto:mattcopp+gllug@gmail.com>Matthew Copperwaite</a>.</p><p>Really hope to see you there.</p><p><a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place?cid=9950840478486936442">The Skinners Arms 114 Judd Street London WC1H 9NT</a></p></div><span class=posts-list-item-description><svg class="icon icon-calendar" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><title>calendar</title><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>
