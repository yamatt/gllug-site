Welcome to the new site.
When Positive Internet contacted me last week letting me know I was using PHP 5.6 – which I subsequently realised went out of support about 7 years ago at this point – I had kind of forgotten I was responsible for the server.
In fact, given the site ran Wordpress, I was astounded the site hadn’t been done over.
Postivie Internet kindly let me know that the upgrade might cause Wordpress to break."><meta property="og:url" content="https://gllug.org.uk/2025/11/27/new-new-site/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Greater London Linux User Group"><meta property="og:title" content="New New Site"><meta property="og:description" content="Hi all.

Take that hackers!</p><p>I also removed the spam that had found it&rsquo;s way in to the site from I think a previous release.</p><p>I was also able to configure it so the old Wordpress URLs are redirected to the new URLs without the need for <code>index.php</code> in the URL.</p><p>I realise this is at least the <a href=/2015/12/21/welcome-to-the-new-gllug-site/>second time the site has been updated</a>.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also got a neat solution for automated deployments as evidenced by this new post which is simply pushed to GitHub and then then synced to the server.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also noticed there have been a few recent meets.</p><p>One of the things I want to do is to capture these on the site in future. This new site should make that easier. Or people who want to publish their meet <a href=https://github.com/yamatt/gllug-site/pulls>can raise a PR</a>.</p><p>Reach out on the mailing list if you see any issues.</p><p>And I am extremely greatful to Positive Internet who have supported this site for many years, and particularly Brad who helped me fix everything, including adding certs to the site.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
